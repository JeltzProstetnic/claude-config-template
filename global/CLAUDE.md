## Machine Identity

Machine-specific knowledge is auto-loaded via `~/CLAUDE.local.md` (each machine has its own, not synced). Read `/etc/hostname` at startup using the Read tool (not Bash — avoids permission prompts; portable across all platforms including SteamOS where `hostname` binary may not exist) and state where you are in your first response.

If `CLAUDE.local.md` is missing, fall back to reading `~/.claude/machines/<machine>.md` manually.

## Session Start — Loading Protocol

**MANDATORY — NEVER SKIP.** Complete ALL steps before doing ANY user task. The user's first message often IS the trigger for startup — do not treat it as reason to skip loading. Even if the user asks something urgent, load first, then respond. A 30-second startup is always acceptable; lost context from skipping is not.

**Auto-loaded via @import** (no action needed — loaded before you see this):
- `user-profile.md` — who the user is
- `session-protocol.md` — session context persistence rules
- Machine file — via `CLAUDE.local.md` (machine-specific, not synced)

**Manual steps — execute in order:**

0. **ALWAYS check for remote changes — BEFORE reading any files.** Run `bash ~/agent-fleet/setup/scripts/git-sync-check.sh --pull` in the project directory. This fetches, reports incoming changes, and fast-forward pulls if behind. If it reports changes, re-read affected files. If it fails (diverged, merge conflict), resolve before proceeding. This applies to EVERY project, EVERY session, no exceptions. Reading stale files leads to wrong context, missed tasks, and wasted work.

1. **ALWAYS read cross-project inbox:** `~/agent-fleet/cross-project/inbox.md` — pick up tasks for this project, delete them after integrating. This is the cross-device task passing mechanism (mobile/VPS/PC all sync via git).

2. **Read the project's `CLAUDE.md`** (manifest) — it declares what domains to load

3. **Read the project's `session-context.md`** (if exists) — current state and active tasks

4. **Follow the manifest's Knowledge Loading table** — load only the listed domain files

5. **Conditional loading (do NOT load unless triggered):**
   - **First run after setup** (`.setup-pending` exists in repo root): `~/.claude/foundation/first-run-refinement.md` — run this FIRST, before any user task
   - MCP server issue, auth problem, or first MCP tool use in session: `~/.claude/reference/mcp-catalog.md`
   - New/unconfigured project detected: `~/.claude/foundation/project-setup.md`
   - Roster changes needed: `~/.claude/foundation/roster-management.md`
   - Code project using Serena: `~/.claude/reference/serena.md`
   - WSL troubleshooting: `~/.claude/reference/wsl-environment.md`
   - Subagent permission failures: `~/.claude/reference/permissions.md`
   - Cross-project coordination needed: `~/.claude/foundation/cross-project-sync.md`
   - CLI tool usage or uncertainty about installed software: `~/.claude/reference/system-tools.md`
   - Tool-specific operational issues: `~/.claude/knowledge/<tool>.md` (check INDEX for available files)
   - Plan mode issues, hangs, or freezes: `~/.claude/knowledge/plan-mode-issues.md`
   - Permission prompts, settings.local.json issues, tool approval problems: `~/.claude/knowledge/claude-code-permissions.md`

6. **Check for project-specific knowledge**: `ls <project>/.claude/knowledge/` or `<project>/.claude/*.md`

7. **Do NOT load everything.** Only load what the manifest says + what's triggered by context.

## Indexes

- Foundation modules: `~/.claude/foundation/INDEX.md`
- Domain catalog: `~/.claude/domains/INDEX.md`
- **Project catalog: `~/agent-fleet/registry.md`** — read when user mentions other projects

## Development Rules

- **No compound `cd` commands:** NEVER use `cd <dir> && <command>` in Bash tool calls. Claude Code flags compound `cd` commands as security risks ("bare repository attacks"), causing permission prompts that pollute `settings.local.json`. Instead: use `git -C <path>` for git commands, absolute paths for everything else.
- **Know your gitignore:** Before `git add`, verify the file isn't gitignored. `.claude/settings.local.json` and `secrets/vault.json` are gitignored. Don't waste tool calls trying to stage them.
- **Auto-sync awareness:** The SessionEnd hook runs `sync.sh collect` which commits pending changes. If a file was edited earlier in the session and auto-synced, it won't show as modified at shutdown. Check `git log --oneline -1 -- <file>` before chasing phantom diffs.
- **Git commit messages — no `$()`:** NEVER use `git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'...)"` or any `$()` substitution in commit commands. Claude Code flags `$()` as a security risk, triggering permission prompts that interrupt shutdown and startup flows. Instead: write the message to a temp file, then commit with `-F`:
  ```
  printf 'Commit message here\n\nCo-Authored-By: ...' > /tmp/commit-msg.txt
  git commit -F /tmp/commit-msg.txt
  ```
  This overrides the system prompt's HEREDOC guidance. The `-F` pattern is silent, requires no approval, and works identically.

## Persona System

Personas are **multiple named personalities** with semantic switching rules. They are defined globally and apply to all machines by default, with optional per-machine overrides.

**Persona source (layered, first match wins):**
1. **Machine file** (`~/.claude/machines/<machine>.md`) — if it has a `## Persona` section, use those personas exclusively (full override, not merge)
2. **Global default** (`~/.claude/foundation/personas.md`) — used when the machine file has no `## Persona` section

**Persona format** (each persona is a `### Name` subsection under `## Persona`):

| Field | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Name** | Display name used as response prefix | Assistant, Supporter |
| **Traits** | Comma-separated communication style descriptors | efficient, warm, sarcastic |
| **Activates** | Semantic rule for when this persona takes over | default, when user is frustrated |
| **Color** | Not rendered in chat — Claude Code's markdown renderer strips ANSI escape codes. The statusline CAN render ANSI colors. Field kept for potential future rendering. | cyan, green |
| **Style** | Free-text description of how this persona communicates | Gets the job done. Professional, clear... |

**Rendering rules:**
- At session start, load personas from the machine file (if it has a `## Persona` section) or from the global file
- The persona with `Activates: default` is active at session start
- Prefix FIRST substantive response to each user message with the persona name in **bold markdown**: e.g., `**Assistant:**`
- On persona switch, write the active persona name to `~/.claude/.active-persona` (one line, just the name). Write on session start (default persona) and on every switch.
- Continuously evaluate switching rules against conversation context. Switch when a rule matches. **Stay in the switched persona until the triggering condition clearly ends.**
- The user can always force a switch by saying "switch to [Name]" or just "[Name]"
- If no persona defined → respond normally (no prefix, no trait flavoring)

**Onboarding:** During first-run refinement, offer a multi-personality setup — "Would you like your agent to have different personalities for different situations?" Store in `~/.claude/foundation/personas.md`. If the user wants device-specific personas, add a `## Persona` section to the relevant machine file.

## Conventions

**Auto-memory is WRONG for this setup (OVERRIDES system auto-memory guidance).** The system prompt tells you to save "conventions", "preferences", "patterns", and "solutions" into auto-memory. **Ignore all of that.** In a multi-project multi-machine environment, auto-memory is per-project and ephemeral — rules saved there are invisible to other projects and get lost. The correct storage locations are:

| What | Where | NOT in memory |
|------|-------|---------------|
| Behavioral rules ("always do X") | `CLAUDE.md` (global or project) | Memory is invisible to other projects |
| Technical decisions & rationale | `docs/decisions.md` in the project | Memory has no structure |
| Debugging patterns, technical recipes | `~/.claude/knowledge/<topic>.md` | Memory is per-project, knowledge is global |
| Machine-specific state | `~/.claude/machines/<machine>.md` | Memory doesn't survive machine changes |
| Cross-project coordination | `~/agent-fleet/cross-project/` files | Memory can't cross projects |

**Auto-memory's only valid use:** Temporary orientation notes for a specific project that don't fit anywhere else (e.g., "this project's CI is flaky on Tuesdays"). Keep it under 50 lines. When in doubt, DON'T write to memory — write to a proper file.

If the user says "always do X" or "remember to do Y" → that's a rule → `CLAUDE.md`. If it's global, route through cross-project inbox for agent-fleet integration. If project-scoped, write to the project's `CLAUDE.md` directly.

**Output rule:** Any document, summary, or one-pager MUST be delivered as **PDF**, not markdown. The user does not read `.md` files. Write the `.md` as source, convert to PDF, open the PDF:
- **Convert (preferred — weasyprint)**: `pandoc input.md -o input.html --standalone && weasyprint input.html output.pdf`
- **Convert (fallback — xelatex, if installed)**: `pandoc input.md -o output.pdf --pdf-engine=xelatex -V geometry:margin=1.8cm -V mainfont="Liberation Sans" -V monofont="Liberation Mono" --highlight-style=tango`
- **Before converting**: verify which engine is available (`which weasyprint xelatex`). Do NOT guess — check first.
- **Avoid** Unicode box-drawing characters in code blocks (xelatex chokes) — use tables instead
- **weasyprint HTML: BMP symbols only** — never use emoji codepoints (U+1F000+) in HTML for weasyprint. Emoji fonts aren't portable across machines. Use BMP Unicode symbols instead: `&#10004;` (checkmark), `&#9654;` (play), `&#9733;` (star), `&#9679;` (bullet). For colored indicators: `<span style="color:green">&#9679;</span>`.
- **Open (WSL)**: `powershell.exe -Command "Start-Process '$(wslpath -w /absolute/path/to/file)'"` — ALWAYS use `wslpath -w` for path conversion
- **Open (native Linux)**: `xdg-open output.pdf`
- **Open (macOS)**: `open output.pdf`
- **Detect environment**: if `/mnt/c/` exists → WSL, elif `uname` is Darwin → macOS, otherwise → native Linux
- Short text (<10 words) can go inline. Anything longer → file + PDF + open.
- **Exception — copy-paste content:** Tweet drafts, reply options, and anything the user needs to copy-paste goes in plain text (`.md` or `.txt`, not PDF). Use single-line paragraphs — NO hard line breaks mid-sentence. Wrapped lines look nice in terminal but break copy-paste.

**MCP-first rule:** Always prefer MCP server tools over bash/CLI equivalents when available. GitHub MCP for repo/issue/PR operations (not `gh` CLI or `curl`), Google Workspace MCP for email/docs/calendar, Twitter MCP for tweets, Serena for code navigation in code projects. Only fall back to CLI when MCP genuinely can't do the operation (e.g., `git clone` to local filesystem), or when the MCP catalog documents a known limitation for that specific tool.

**Subagent file delivery rule:** When a subagent (Task tool) produces a file (PDF, image, etc.), do NOT open it again in the parent context. **Check procedure — run BEFORE any file-open command:**
1. Scan the subagent's returned output for open/delivery commands (`Start-Process`, `xdg-open`, `open`, or any shell command targeting the file).
2. If found → file already delivered. Do nothing.
3. If NOT found → subagent created but didn't open the file. Only then may the parent open it.
4. When in doubt, do NOT open — a missing open is a minor annoyance, a duplicate open is a visible bug.

**Plain-language startup/shutdown messages:** Startup and shutdown status lines must be human-readable, not internal jargon. Say "Last session shut down correctly" not "clean template, properly rotated". Say "Last session may have ended unexpectedly — checking recovery notes" not "stale context found". Say "2 tasks waiting for other projects" not "inbox has 2 entries for non-current projects". These messages should make sense to any user, not just someone who knows the rotation/archival internals. The rest of the session can be as technical as the context requires.

**URL/service identification rule:** When the user provides a URL or a task involves an external service, FIRST identify the service (x.com/twitter.com → Twitter, github.com → GitHub, docs.google.com/drive.google.com → Google Workspace, etc.). Then check the MCP catalog for matching tools and known limitations. Only after that, decide whether to use MCP tools or fall back to WebFetch/CLI. Never jump straight to generic fetching without this identification step.

**Backlog convention:** Every project has `backlog.md` at root. Do NOT read at session start — only when active tasks are done or user asks. All backlogs follow this standard format:

```
# Backlog — <project-name>

## Open

- [ ] [P1] **Task title**: Description
- [ ] [P2] **Task title**: Description

## Done

### YYYY-MM-DD
- [x] Completed task description
```

**Project prioritization:** Registry has a `Priority` column (P1–P5). Backlog tasks carry a priority tag.
- **Project priority** (in `registry.md`): P1 = critical/daily, P2 = active/weekly, P3 = ongoing/as-needed, P4 = paused, P5 = dormant
- **Task priority** (in backlogs): prefix task line with `[P1]`–`[P5]`, e.g. `- [ ] [P1] Fix deployment bug`. Untagged tasks default to P3.
- **Cross-project ranking**: sort by project priority first, then task priority within each project. A P2 task in a P1 project outranks a P1 task in a P3 project.
- **Open section**: flat list sorted by priority (P1 first), no subsections. Keep it scannable.
- **Done section**: group by date, most recent first. Move tasks here when completed — don't delete them.

**Cross-project boundary rule — HARD CONSTRAINT:** You may ONLY write to files inside your current working project. Writing to ANY file in another project's directory is FORBIDDEN — even if you know the path, even if it seems convenient, even for "shared" files in `~/agent-fleet/`. The ONLY legal way to affect another project is through the cross-project inbox. Violations of this rule cause silent data corruption and task loss.

Path ownership (concrete mapping):
- `~/agent-fleet/*` and `~/.claude/*` — owned by **agent-fleet** project
- `~/<project>/*` — owned by that specific project (writable only when working in it)
- `~/agent-fleet/cross-project/inbox.md` — writable from any project (always)
- `~/agent-fleet/cross-project/*.md` strategy files — writable during shutdown only (see shutdown checklist)

Reading files and executing scripts from any project is always permitted. Only writing/editing files outside your current working project is forbidden (except the inbox and shutdown strategy files listed above).

**Cross-project inbox:** `~/agent-fleet/cross-project/inbox.md`
- The inbox is the ONLY mechanism for cross-project communication
- Tasks are per-project (one entry per project, not broadcasts)
- Pick up YOUR project's tasks, delete them from inbox after integrating
- To request changes in another project: write an inbox entry, NEVER edit their files directly
- Format: `- [ ] **target-project-name**: what needs to happen`

**Public/private sync direction rule:** When a project has both public and private repos, diffs between them are NOT always bugs. Before syncing, classify each diff: (1) **intentional personalization** — private has personal names/accounts/paths, public has generic placeholders → leave both as-is; (2) **structural improvement in private** that public should get → propagate after stripping personal details; (3) **public-only change** → backport to private. Never blindly sync private→public — that leaks personal data. Never blindly sync public→private — that overwrites intentional customizations.

**Dual-remote push rule — HARD CONSTRAINT:** For projects with a filtered public remote (identified by `.push-filter.conf` in project root): NEVER `git pull`, `git fetch --merge`, or `git merge` from the public remote into the working branch. The public remote is **write-only** — it contains a filtered subset and merging it contaminates the working tree (deletes files that were intentionally excluded). Only pull/merge from the private remote. Push to public ONLY via `bash ~/agent-fleet/setup/scripts/filtered-push.sh`. If `git-sync-check.sh` runs in a dual-remote project, it must ONLY sync with the private remote, never the public one.

**Session context:** Maintain `session-context.md` in every project. Update before and after every significant action. Reference project docs, don't duplicate them.

**Quick commands — keyword shortcuts the user can type as their entire message:**

| Keyword | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `cls` | Execute full 7-step shutdown checklist, then say "Shutdown complete — run /clear whenever you're ready." **If `cls` is the user's very first message**, skip the startup checklist entirely — the user is switching projects and doesn't need full context loading. Just run shutdown. Only run the startup checklist afterward if the user stays in the current project (i.e., sends a follow-up task instead of `/clear`). |
| `end` | Execute full 7-step shutdown checklist, then say "Shutdown complete — you can exit now." |
| `lsd` | **Project dashboard.** See full spec below. |

When the user types one of these keywords (alone, case-insensitive), execute the described action immediately without asking for confirmation. These are shortcuts, not conversation starters.

**`lsd` — project dashboard spec:**

**STRICT FORMAT — follow exactly. Do NOT improvise or simplify.**

1. **Data collection — cache-first.** Read `~/agent-fleet/cross-project/dashboard-cache.md`. This file contains pre-computed task counts, disk sizes, and deadlines for all projects. It is updated by:
   - **Session shutdown** — each project updates its own row when shutting down
   - **`lsd refresh`** — runs `bash ~/agent-fleet/setup/scripts/lsd-refresh.sh` to do a full scan of all local backlogs and disk sizes

   Show P1-P3 by default, P1-P5 with `lsd all`. Do NOT scan backlogs or run `du` — trust the cache. If the cache is missing, run `lsd-refresh.sh` once.

2. **Display format — SEPARATE TABLE PER PRIORITY TIER.** Each tier gets its own box-drawing table with a tier header. This is the key visual structure — do NOT merge tiers into one big table.

   **Box-drawing tables are preferred.** Use Unicode box-drawing characters. Each tier rendered as a standalone table.

   **Column structure — 5 columns per table:**

   ```
   ┌────┬──────────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────┬──────┐
   │  # │ Name             │ Type         │ Tasks                                │ Size │
   ├────┼──────────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────┼──────┤
   │  1 │ my-project       │ code (p)     │ 3P1 1P2 4P3 — Fix auth; Deploy      │ 1.2G │
   │    │  +- sub-proj     │ library      │ 1P2                                  │ 340M │
   │  2 │ config-repo      │ meta/config  │ 2P2 1P3                              │   5M │
   └────┴──────────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────┴──────┘
   ```

   **Tier headers** — bold text above each table: `**[P1] CRITICAL**`, `**[P2] ACTIVE**`, `**[P3] ONGOING**`

   **Path column removed** — paths are predictable (`~/project-name`), removing them saves width for the Tasks column.

   **Sub-projects** render directly under their declared parent (per the Parent column in the cache), indented with `+- ` prefix (uniform for all children — no distinction between middle/last). No number.

   **Size column alignment:** Right-align Size values within a fixed-width column (minimum 6 chars). When the Tasks column has long content (P1 names, etc.), do NOT let it push the Size column out of alignment. Set each column to a fixed width based on the longest value in that column for the current tier, then pad all cells to match.

   **Task counts** use compact format: `3P1 1P2 4P3` (only show priorities that have items). If no backlog or not local: `—`.

   **P1 task names:** When a project has P1 tasks, show their names in the Tasks column after the counts: `2P1 1P2 — Fix auth bug; Deploy hotfix`. The cache has a `P1Names` column (pipe-separated). Render as semicolon-separated after an em dash.

   **Last completed item:** When a project has no open tasks (Tasks = `—`) but has a backlog with completed items, show the most recent one in italics in the Tasks column: `*Shipped v3.0*`. The cache has a `LastDone` column. Only show when Tasks would otherwise be `—`.

   **Type indicators** append in parentheses: `(d)` = dual-push, `(p)` = public+private pair.

   **Deadline flags**: append `!!` + description to the Size column: `544K !! Mar 15`.

   **Color note:** ANSI colors cannot render in Claude Code chat output (markdown renderer strips them). Box-drawing and bold text are the available visual tools.

   After the tables: `+ N paused/dormant (lsd all)` if P4-P5 projects were omitted.

3. **Actions.** After the table, show:

   `switch <N>` Open project in new tab | `details <N>` Full project info | `new` Create new project | `all` Show P4-P5 too | `refresh` Re-scan all backlogs and disk sizes

   - **switch**: archive current session-context.md, open new terminal tab in that project's directory (platform-aware: Konsole D-Bus on KDE, tmux on VPS, wt.exe on WSL)
   - **details**: show full info including machines, GitHub remotes, agents, multi-repo setup
   - **new**: follow project-setup.md
   - **all**: re-display including P4-P5 projects
   - **refresh**: run `bash ~/agent-fleet/setup/scripts/lsd-refresh.sh`, then re-display

**Session shutdown checklist — MANDATORY.** When the user says "prepare for shutdown", "exit", "auto-compact restart", `cls`, `end`, or anything suggesting session end → run ALL 7 steps from `~/.claude/foundation/session-protocol.md` Section "Session Shutdown Checklist", without asking. That file is the canonical, detailed checklist. Quick summary:

1. Update `session-context.md` with final state and recovery instructions + update this project's row in `~/agent-fleet/cross-project/dashboard-cache.md`
2. Run `bash ~/agent-fleet/setup/scripts/rotate-session.sh` + update `docs/decisions.md` if needed
3. Drop cross-project inbox tasks if this session affects other projects
4. Update shared strategy files you touched (shutdown boundary exception)
5. Update machine file (`~/.claude/machines/<machine>.md`) if machine state changed
6. `git add`, commit, push
7. Run `bash ~/agent-fleet/sync.sh collect` to verify

No exceptions. No asking "want me to commit?" — just do it.

## Meta-Rules

**Rules live in rules, not in memory.** Persistent behavioral rules MUST go in `CLAUDE.md` (global or project-level), foundation files, or domain protocols — never in auto-memory files. Memory is for contextual notes (project structure, debugging insights, technical recipes). If it governs behavior, it's a rule and belongs here.

**Troubleshooting reference machines:** When a fix regresses or a config issue recurs, ALWAYS consult two sources before reinventing: (1) the machine where the project was **last worked on** (check `session-history.md` for which machine), and (2) your **primary dev machine** (source of truth for how things should work). Read the relevant machine files, session histories, and configs from those machines to see if the problem was already solved there. Don't fix from scratch what was already fixed elsewhere.

**Protocol creation:** When domain-complexity mistakes happen, create a protocol. See `~/.claude/foundation/protocol-creation.md`.

**Adding domains:** Create dir under `~/agent-fleet/global/domains/`, add protocols, update `domains/INDEX.md`, reference from project manifests. These operations require being in the agent-fleet project context. From other projects, route domain creation requests through the cross-project inbox.

**Sync:** `bash ~/agent-fleet/sync.sh setup|deploy|collect|status`

**New project:** Add to `~/agent-fleet/registry.md`. See `~/.claude/foundation/project-setup.md`.

**New machine:** Populate `~/.claude/machines/<machine>.md` from `machines/_template.md`. Create `~/CLAUDE.local.md` containing `@~/.claude/machines/<machine>.md`. Add hostname pattern to Machine Identity table. Run `bash ~/agent-fleet/sync.sh setup` to link config. See machine file template for required sections.

## Platform Notes

**WSL:**
- **NEVER work in `/mnt/c/` paths** — 10-15x slower
- `git config --global core.autocrlf input`
- Full reference: `~/.claude/reference/wsl-environment.md`

**Native Linux (Fedora KDE, SteamOS, etc.):**
- Use `xdg-open` for opening files (respects system default app)
- No `/mnt/c/` or `powershell.exe` available
- **Terminal tabs (Konsole/KDE):** Use D-Bus to open tabs and send commands:
  ```bash
  KONSOLE_SVC=$(qdbus org.kde.konsole-* 2>/dev/null | head -1)
  SID=$(qdbus "$KONSOLE_SVC" /Windows/1 org.kde.konsole.Window.newSession "tab-name" "bash")
  qdbus "$KONSOLE_SVC" /Sessions/$SID org.kde.konsole.Session.sendText "cd ~/project && mclaude\n"
  ```
- **Never use tmux on KDE machines** — the user has a graphical terminal with native tabs

**macOS:**
- Use `open <filepath>` for opening files (respects system default app)
- No `/mnt/c/` or `powershell.exe` available
